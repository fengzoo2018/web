Raise warning when saving
=========================

This module was written to extend the functionality of saving a record in the web interface.

/!\\/!\\/!\\

In no way this module stops the save of the record. You must consider this as a warning displayed 
to the user AFTER save completed.

/!\\/!\\/!\\

If you don't want Odoo to save the record, you should use constraints.

Installation
------------




Configuration
-------------




Usage
-----







=====

To use this module, you need to:

* write a method called 'check_warning_on_save' which will make some checks and return a string

example :

.. code:: python

    def check_warning_on_save(self, cr, uid, id, context=None):
        """
            @param: int: record_id
            @return: string: message that should be displayed to the user
        """
        res = ""

        record = self.browse(cr, uid, id, context=context)
        # ... make some checks

        return res
